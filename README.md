# svg-generator

Static website with some vanilla JS that lets you customize and generate abstract SVG art and download the file. Tweak the parameters for grid size, triangle/circle frequency, and provide custom color palettes to find the right style for you.

Hid some fun bits in here, like the hover states of the two buttons grab a random color from the current artwork + alter the font color based on the background luminosity for accessibility purposes, invalid hex values are filtered out, and blank color inputs get replaced by a random default color array.

Couple things I'll tweak next time I'm working on this - a "randomize" button to shuffle existing inputs, a color palette generator, and making it mobile friendly. At some point I'll probably add a `.png` option, since SVGs aren't always useful (especially on a phone).

¯\_(ツ)_/¯
